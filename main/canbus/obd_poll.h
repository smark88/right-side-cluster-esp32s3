// OBD-II Mode 01 poller.
//
// Fuel level, intake air temp, boost, fuel pressure and AFR are not broadcast
// on GM's bus -- which is why they appear in no DBC -- but they are all
// standard SAE J1979 PIDs on the same high speed bus. This is how a scan tool
// reads them.
//
// UNLIKE THE REST OF THE CAN CODE, THIS TRANSMITS.
// Everything else in this project listens passively. Polling sends request
// frames to 0x7DF and reads the reply from 0x7E8. That is exactly what any
// scan tool does and is safe on a running vehicle, but it is an active
// participant on the bus rather than a silent observer. Set OBD_POLL_ENABLE
// to 0 to go back to listen-only.
//
// Only single-frame requests are supported. Every PID below returns one or
// two data bytes, which fits. Multi-frame PIDs such as 0x68 (IAT per bank)
// and 0x70 (boost control) would need ISO-TP reassembly and are not handled.
